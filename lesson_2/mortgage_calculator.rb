# Let's figure out a mortgage calculator!
# Collect from user:
# --current balance
# --APR
# --remaining term
# ----years
#
# From above, I will calculate:
# --monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
# --loan duration in months ( term * 12)
# --monthly payment (formula below)
#
# formula:
# -- mortgage_payment =
# loan_amount * (monthly_interest /
#         (1 - (1 + monthly interest)**(-term)))
#
# Helper functions needed:
# --prompt
# --pause for effect
# --validate numerical input
# --convert yearly term to months
# --calculate monthly interest rate
# --calculate monthly payments
# --convert interest rate to percentage
# --report results

Welcome to the mortgage calculator!
We will take your mortgage amount, term in years, and interest rate.
Then, we'll provide your monthly payment.
Here we go!

Please enter your interest rate.
Please enter it as 0.##
5% would be 0.05
6.75% would be 0.0675
10% would be 0.10
